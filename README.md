# Assembly Introduction - ECSE324 Lab2

This was a brief introduction to ARM Assembly in class where we had 3 different tasks of converting C to Assembly. 
* Part 1 Consisted of converting C code of Erastothenes Primes to find prime numbers in a list. 
* Part 2 consisted of 2 parts where we had to calculate pell numbers in both Recursive and Iterative examples.
* Part 3 consisted of writing 2 sorting algorithms, where I chose selection sort and bubble sort
